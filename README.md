# LightTheDepths
An underwater light module for use with pelagic stereo-BRUVs with built in depth sensor data logger.

Underwater enclosure details:
BlueRobotics Watertight Enclosure 100mm diameter, 300mm long aluminum with 1 blank acrylic end cap and one aluminum 5 hole (M10) end cap.

Depth sensor details:
BlueRobotics Bar30 sensor with I2C level converter driven by Uno microcontroller with ethernet SD shield for writing data.

Battery details:
Both the Uno microcontroller and the LED lights are powered by 7 Amp hour 14 V custom made rechargable battery pack. Batterys were sourced from: https://www.premierbatteries.com.au/

LED details:
LEDs consist of Cree XPG3 Royal Blue on a 6 UP PCB. Driven by CUTE-48-1.00W DC DC driver. LEDs are wired in series strings of two LEDs and each string has its own driver. The three drivers are wired in parallel to the battery. An Anna-40-60-S-XP-G optic is used to direct light and a heatsink to move heat away from LEDs. All LED and wiring equiptment was sourced from: https://www.cutter.com.au/
Blue lights are used to minimise the behavioural impact of the lights on fishes.
